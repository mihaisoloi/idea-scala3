## sbt example project compiled with Scala 3

In IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2.1 you get compile errors, thus you can't build the project at all and can't run the tests.

If you're using Metals then it's fine.

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).
